Holds 25 percent or more of the ownership interest in a reporting company, or 2. Exercises substantial control over a reporting company. Importantly, the definition of \"beneficial owner\" only includes individuals who are natural persons.

An individual exercise substantial control over a reporting company if that individual: (A) Serves as a senior officer of the reporting company; (B) Has authority over the appointment or removal of any senior officer or a majority of the board of directors (or similar body); (C) Directs, determines, or has substantial influence over important decisions made by the reporting company, including decisions regarding: (1) The nature, scope, and attributes of the business of the reporting company, including the sale, lease, mortgage, or other transfer of any principal assets of the reporting company; (2) The reorganization, dissolution, or merger of the reporting company; (3) Major expenditures or investments, issuances of any equity, incurrence of any significant debt, or approval of the operating budget of the reporting company; (4) The selection or termination of business lines or ventures, or geographic focus, of the reporting company; (5) Compensation schemes and incentive programs for senior officers; (6) The entry into or termination, or the fulfillment or non-fulfillment, of significant contracts; (7) Amendments of any substantial governance documents of the reporting company, including the articles of incorporation or similar formation documents, bylaws, and significant policies or procedures; or (D) Has any other form of substantial control over the reporting company.

Generally, if the individual falls into any of the categories below the individual could be exercising substantial control:\n•  The individual is a senior officer (the company’s president, chief financial officer, general counsel, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, or any other officer who performs a similar function).\n•  The individual has the authority to appoint or remove certain officers or a majority of directors (or similar body) of the reporting company.\n•  The individual is an important decision-maker for the reporting company, including decisions regarding the reporting company's business, finances, or structure.\n•  The individual has any other form of substantial control over the reporting company. Control exercised in new and unique ways can still be substantial."
